Repository Contains Ignitus Meta-Data.

I’d like to introduce Ignitus (A Non-Profit Organization ) that helps students and professionals get handpicked top-quality global research and industrial internships, for free! The students participate in projects and training programs supervised by our experts. Our only goal is- 'Skyrocketing a students’ career by providing best global opportunities'.
The platform has got exponential growth after successful internship completion by the associated students with researchers from SAIL (Stanford AI Lab) and Oxford University.

Ignitus is working with a non-profit (GirlsScript Foundation) which is committed to bringing together multiple such initiatives for a grand scale open-source project development program for women.

We have come a long way from humble beginnings, we now have 300+ targeted students, researchers who have actively volunteered to be a part of our organization.
We aim to serve a larger student community in future.

Team Ignitus boasts of a dedicated workforce from Boston, Florida, Pittsburg, Madrid, Houston, Munich and different parts of India.
